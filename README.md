# Convex-Cone
Hello everyone. I would like to share a paper on 'Convex Cone' which was done jointly with Debartha Paul and Sayantika Sengupta during our Bachelors. In this presentation, we have explored the meaning of a convex cone and where exactly we might use it. I hope you all find this informative.
